Objective:-
To design and develop a full-stack end-to-end room booking website for a resort. The platform will include a responsive frontend for customers, a robust admin dashboard, real-time room availability management, and integration with a payment gateway for seamless transactions.

Project Brief:-
The project aims to simplify the room booking process in a resort by offering an online platform where customers can check room availability, make bookings, and complete payments securely. The admin panel will allow resort management to add, update, and delete rooms, view and manage bookings, and handle customer queries efficiently. The system will be designed with scalability, usability, and security in mind.
